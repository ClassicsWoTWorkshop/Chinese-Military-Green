Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of all HD Chinese tanks from their default light-teal to a darker green color, similar to that of some modern Chinese vehicles and artillery.
Included are skins for all HD Chinese vehicles and matching icons for the garage and tech tree.

To install:
- Drag the "res_mods" folder from inside this zip to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).

Enjoy!
