Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of all HD Chinese tanks from their default light-teal to a darker green color, similar to that of some modern Chinese vehicles and artillery.
Included are skins for all HD Chinese vehicles and matching icons for the garage and tech tree.

To install:
- Drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from inside the included "MAIN MOD (Install this FIRST)" folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\<version>) (example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).

Optional:
- If you want to add turret decorations from the 113 BO to the standard 113 without the skin (see "PREVIEW-What-this-addon-does.png" in the ADDON folder to... well, see what it does), drag the "scripts" and "vehicles" folders from inside the "ADDON - 113 Turret Decorations from 'Beijing Opera' Edition" folder to <Your WoT Directory\res_mods\<Game Version>\ (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.19.1\).

- If you want to swap the gun model of the 152mm cannon on both the WZ-111G FT & 113G FT (see "PREVIEW-What-this-addon-does.png" in the ADDON folder, you probably get the idea why), drag the "China_TD_T9_10_Gun_Replacements.wotmod" from inside the "ADDON - 152mm gun model replacement for WZ-111G FT & 113G FT (made by Milkym4n)" folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>\ (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\0.9.20.0\). Note the difference - this one, unlike the previous two, goes to the "mods" folder instead of "res_mods" - it will not work otherwise.

Enjoy!
