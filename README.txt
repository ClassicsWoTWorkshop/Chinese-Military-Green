Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of all HD Chinese tanks from their default light-teal to a darker green color, similar to that of some modern Chinese vehicles and artillery.
Included are skins for all HD Chinese vehicles and matching icons for the garage and tech tree.

To install:
- Drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from inside the included "MAIN MOD (Install this FIRST)" folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\<version>) (example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).

Optional:
- If you want to add turret decorations from the 113 BO to the standard 113 without the skin (see "PREVIEW-What-this-addon-does.png" in the ADDON folder to... well, see what it does), drag the "scripts" and "vehicles" folders from inside the "ADDON - 113 Turret Decorations from 'Beijing Opera' Edition" folder to <Your WoT Directory\res_mods\<Game Version>\ (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.19.1\).

Enjoy!
